Some notes for leading a structured conversation designed to guide people through thinking about community care / looking after your volunteers. It's more than just a CoC.

====

- Have you ever done volunteer work before (unpaid work, usually in your own time)?
  - How much did you do and how did the work make you feel?

====

- When is asking for unpaid work too much?
  - A few minutes or an hour here or there? (example: simple bug fix)
  - How would you feel about being asked to spend several hours, days or a week doing unpaid work?  (possible examples: reviewing a long paper, or reviewing abstracts for a conference).
  - What about if you were asked to spend several hours a week for several months at a time? (e.g. organising a conference)

===

- Have you ever felt burnt out from volunteer work?

My tips:
- If you're managing volunteers - be as generous as you can afford to be
  - Stickers are great, but a few stickers for hours of work can be a bit of a slap in the face.
  - One of the best forms of payment is... money!
    - That isn't something we always have available to us though :sob:
  - You should also do other things for your community and volunteers whenever you can:
    - recommendation letters - half an hour to write but they can be the difference in making a job, or not.
    - sharing exciting/useful opportunities and championing your members
      - e.g. conferences with travel bursaries (example - [eLife sprint](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/))
      - Funding fellowships
      - Nominate them for awards!
      - Bring them into the leadership [with caution, don't burn them out further!]
