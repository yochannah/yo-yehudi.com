BiVi this year was exhaustingly busy but good fun to attend with some great networking activities. As usual I [live tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/moments/856517477781708801) on the first day, gave a [lightning talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZII8Np0wUP-ugognNPL1KR-5ThwSbM465DKdZ_AJG6A/edit?usp=sharing) - 3 slides in 1 minute, phew! - and presented an InterMine poster.

The second day was mostly interactive workshops, so I found myself recording notes in a Gist instead:
