            <h1>I like to make science open.</h1>

            <p><strong>In my day job</strong>, I'm the Executive Director of <a href="https://we-are-ols.org/">Open Life Science</a>, a non-profit mentoring and training company dedicated to building a global network of open research ambassadors. I hold a Doctorate of Engineering from the University of Manchester.</p> 

            <p>Prior to this, I was Open Source Technology Lead at the Wellcome Trust, and before that an open source research software engineer and community manager at <a href="http://intermine.org">InterMine</a>, based at the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. <a href="https://yochannah.github.io/cv/">Browse my CV</a>.</p>

            <p>I like cycling, running, and hiking, and I'm currently working my fitness back up after rehabilitating an injury.</p>
