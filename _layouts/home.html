            <h1>I like to make science open.</h1>

            <p><strong>In my day job</strong>, I'm the Executive Director of <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Life Science</a>, a non-profit mentoring and training company dedicated to building a global network of open research ambassadors.</p>

            <p>Prior to this, I was Open Source Technology Lead at the Wellcome Trust, and before that an open source research software engineer and community manager at <a href="http://intermine.org">InterMine</a>, based at the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. <a href="https://yochannah.github.io/cv/">Browse my CV</a>.</p>

            <h2>Outside of work, I have one big side project</h2>

            <ol>
              <li> My <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/yochannah.yehudi-postgrad.html">EngD degree</a> with the University of Manchester, with a focus on human aspects of software from a life science perspective - see current projects and recent reading at <a href="http://omgscience.co.uk/projects/">omgscience.co.uk</a>. Currently in my final year ðŸ˜±.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In a pre-pandemic world I used to run and bike a lot; I'm looking forward to taking that back up when it's safe to be around other humans again.</p>
