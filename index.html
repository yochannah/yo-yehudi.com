    <h1>I like to make the internet.</h1>
    <main>
      <p>I'm a web developer comfy with serverside, front-end, and mobile, (I guess they call that full stack) but I like making things with UIs the most. I also like observing people using UIs and acting upon those observations.</p>
      <p>You can see some of <a href="https://github.com/yochannah">my open-source work on GitHub</a>. In particular, check out <a href="https://github.com/yochannah/bluegenes">Bluegenes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yochannah/go-intermod">the InterMod GO tool</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/yochannah/cytoscape-intermine">cytoscape-intermine</a>. You'll note that most of my stuff is Java/Android, Javascript, or, more recently, Clojure or ClojureScript.</p>
      <p>Here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoyehudi">LinkedIn</a> profile, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1542891/yochannah">here's my stackoverflow profile</a>.</p>
