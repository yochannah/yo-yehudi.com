## Email
For anything longer format, please email me on [yo@openlifesci.org](mailto:y.yehudi@wellcome.org) or [yochannah@gmail.com](mailto:yochannah@gmail.com). (Note that I only check the Open Life Science address during UK work hours).

## Urgent response needed?

The fastest was to contact me for quick issues is usually via Twitter - I'm [yoyehudi](twitter.com/yoyehudi) there.

## Looking to chat?

 I'm happy to chat for any reason, but especially keen to offer advice and mentorship to people who are taking their first steps in open source. <a href="https://calendly.com/yo-yehudi/">Book some time in my calendar.</a>
