## Looking to chat?

 I'm happy to chat for any reason, but especially keen to offer advice and mentorship to people who are taking their first steps in open source, open science, or in research - whether or not you're in academia. [Book some time in my calendar](https://app.reclaim.ai/m/yoyehudi) - or email camille@we-are-ols.org to find a time if there isn't anything that works.
